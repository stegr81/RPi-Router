## Using a Raspberry Pi's WiFi Connection to Provide Internet to Devices via Ethernet

During periods away from home I spend significant time in accommodation that has public wifi that requires a user to login on a splash page with no direct access to a router. I wanted to be able to use some IoT devices, mainly wifi enabled power outlets, to control things like light and heating. Initially it was just so I could turn on the heat on my way there rather than arrive to a cold room, but I had other ideas along the way.
